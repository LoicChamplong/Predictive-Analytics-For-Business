    "A diamond distributor has recently decided to exit the market and has put up a set of 3,000 diamonds up for auction. Seeing this as a great opportunity to expand its inventory, a jewelry company has shown interest in making a bid. To decide how much to bid, the company’s analytics team used a large database of diamond prices to build a linear regression model to predict the price of a diamond based on its attributes. You, as the business analysts, are tasked to apply that model to make a recommendation for how much the company should bid for the entire set of 3,000 diamonds.\n",

However, the predicted prices are in a much narrower range than the actual set of prices. This indicates that other factors that are not included in the model affect the price. It is also worth to mentioned that there’s one large outlier in the set that sells for over $30,000. Lastly, the predicted price of some diamonds is less than zero."
