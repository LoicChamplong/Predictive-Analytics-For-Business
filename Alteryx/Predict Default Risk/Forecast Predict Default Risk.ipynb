    "Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression is a statistical model that in its basic form uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable, although many more complex extensions exist. In regression analysis, logistic regression (or logit regression) is estimating the parameters of a logistic model (a form of binary regression). Mathematically, a binary logistic model has a dependent variable with two possible values, such as pass/fail which is represented by an indicator variable, where the two values are labeled \"0\" and \"1\". In the logistic model, the log-odds (the logarithm of the odds) for the value labeled \"1\" is a linear combination of one or more independent variables (\"predictors\"); the independent variables can each be a binary variable (two classes, coded by an indicator variable) or a continuous variable (any real value). The corresponding probability of the value labeled \"1\" can vary between 0 (certainly the value \"0\") and 1 (certainly the value \"1\"), hence the labeling; the function that converts log-odds to probability is the logistic function, hence the name.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, the results from the Logistic Regression Model Stepwise indicates a R-Squared of 0.2 which is low. In this context, a low R-squared value indicates that our independent variable does not explain much in the variation of our dependent variable. The logistic regression model might not be the one we’d to use in to predict the trustworthiness of our future clients. Account Balance, Purpose and Credit Amount are the top 3 most significant variables with p-value of less than 0.05. The accuracy of the model is 0.76."
