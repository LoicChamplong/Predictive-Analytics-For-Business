# Predict Default Risk

Context:

I work for a small bank and I am responsible for determining if customers are creditworthy to give a loan to. My team typically gets 200 loan applications per week and approves them by hand.

Due to a financial scandal that hit a competitive bank last week, I suddenly have an influx of new people applying for loans for my company instead of the other bank in my city. All of a sudden we have nearly 500 loan applications to process this week!

My manager sees this new influx as a great opportunity and wants you to figure out how to process all of these loan applications within one week.

I have the following information to work with:

Data on all past applications
The list of customers that need to be processed in the next few days

Software: Alteryx was used for this project.
