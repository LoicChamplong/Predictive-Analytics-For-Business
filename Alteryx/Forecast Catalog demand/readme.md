# Forecat Catalog demand 

I analysed a business problem in the mail-order catalog business. I was tasked with predicting how much money my company can expect to earn from sending out a catalog to new customers. This task involved building the model and applying the results in order to provide a recommendation to management.

Context:

I work for a company that makes and sells high-end home goods. The company has 250 new customers from their mailing list that they want to send the catalog to. I have been asked to determine how much profit the company can make from sending a catalog to these new customers. We need to predict the expected profit. Management does not want to send the catalog unless the expected profit exceeds $10,000.

Software: Alteryx was used for this project.
