# Forecat Video Game Sales 

Context:

I recently started working for a company as a supply chain analyst that creates and sells video games. Many businesses have to be on point when it comes to ordering supplies to meet the demand of its customers. An overestimation of demand leads to bloated inventory and high costs. Underestimating demand means many valued customers won't get the products they want. Your manager has tasked me to forecast monthly sales data in order to synchronize supply with demand, aid in decision making that will help build a competitive infrastructure and measure company performance. You, the supply chain analyst, are assigned to help your manager run the numbers through a time series forecasting model.

Iâ€™ve been asked to provide a forecast for the next 4 months of sales and report my findings.

Steps to Success
Step 1: Investigate and Prepare the Data
Look at my data set and determine whether the data is appropriate to use time series models. Determine which records should be held for validation later on.

Step 2: Determine Trend, Seasonal and Error components
Graph the data set and decompose the time series into its three main components: trend, seasonality, and error.

Step 3: Build the Models
Determine the appropriate measurements to apply to the ARIMA and ETS models and describe the errors for both models.

Step 4: Forecast
Compare the in-sample error measurements to both models and compare error measurements for the holdout sample in the forecast. Choose the best fitting model and forecast the next four periods.
